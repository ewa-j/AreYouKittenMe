## About

Kitten is feeling pawfully sleepy after a day of being adorable. As the clock ticks down & the need for a nap threatens to take over, kitten must defy all odds & get safely home so they can have a well deserved snooze.

Players will solve challenging puzzles that arise on Kitten's way home, eat delicious treats, avoid perilous enemies, and score points to enjoy the glory of seeing your highscore in shining lights!

Are You Kitten Me? is a hiss-terical **adventure role playing game** currently developed for mobile on the android platform.

With a charming nostalgia style game play that is reminiscent of classic 8-bit arcade games that defined an entire genre.

Languages: Java, XML
Platform: Android Studio

### Why? (motivation)

As lovers of RPG's, puzzles, all things whimsical and quirky, and - of course - cats, this game felt like a combination of the things we love.

As soon as we decided for the protagonist to be a Kitten, the rest - cucumbers as mortal enemies, chasing butterflies, catching fish - just all seemed to naturally fall into place.

We wanted to create a game that was fun to play, a little different and brings a smile to your face. We were also mindful to keep things simple and realistically able to complete within the two weeks we were given.

We decided to create a mobile game in Android Studio as with the increasing popularity of mobile devices we wanted to learn how to develop for these devices. We were also interested in learning more about game development and the Android platform.

## Design

### Colour Palette

Are You Kitten Me was designed to be quint & whimsical, so we though a pastel colour palette would be perfect.

### Graphics

We chose 8 bit graphics as the style of the gameplay. This is due to the timeless nature of the retro arcade gaming genre which has become increasingly popular, as well as how simple and effective this style can be with limited time to complete the project.

Here are some examples of graphic & how they have evolved over time:

#### Kitten Sprite

We changed the Kitten to orange to better standout against our background & colour palette.
